Create a folder somewhere

Open command prompt as Administrator:
	- Click Start
	- Type "cmd"
	- Right click on cmd.exe
	- Select Run as Administrator

Switch to that folder you created

Type "ember new myApp" without the ""
Type "cd myApp"

Have a copy of the Bravo repository posted on the CS website

In that repository go to "Web Interface/RRS"

Copy everything in this folder and paste into the "myApp" folder you created earlier
Say yes to everything about merging and copying

In command prompt again:

Type "npm install" into command prompt
Type "bower install"

If you get an error about a specified version follow these instructions:
	- Open "bower.json" in the myApp folder
	- On the "ember": "~2.4.1" line, change the "2.4.1" to the version
	  that you have installed (it says in the error you got)
	- Save this document
	- Type "bower install"
	- Type "ember server"

Otherwise just type "ember server"

Open a browser and go to http://localhost:4200/, you might have to wait a bit for the page
to display

Hope this helps!
