	\section{Introduction}
		\paragraph\newline
			In this document we will be providing our findings on testing the individual web interfaces of teams Alpha and Bravo in regards to the COS 301 mini-project.

	\section{The functionality that is correctly implemented - Alpha}
		\paragraph\newline			
			Due to the back-end of the project never being fully completed and integrated, it is difficult to accurately establish what was and what wasn't correctly implemented as nothing can be thoroughly tested, however, after following the readme that was placed in the repository, the website was indeed running and could be navigated.
			\newline
			\newline
			With regards to publications, there is a link to publications itself, which comes across as an add publications page. There is a sub-field in which you can change the current life-cycle state of the publication but upon testing it was established that there was only one field to choose from but the functionality was there none-the-less.The ability to change the publication title and envisaged completion date work very well and meet requirements.
			\newline
			\newline
			When navigating to the research page, the functionality to add, suspend or reactivate a research group exists and it is well set out and easy to navigate. Obviously due to the lack of a back-end there is no way to test if the object is actually being sent.
			The researcher category addition and modification pages are also implemented and are according to spec.
			\newline
			\newline
			The overall aesthetic look of the website is good and navigation is simple and easy, nothing seemingly difficult or painful to use.
	
	
\section{Missing Functionality - Bravo}
With the back-end of the system not completed, plugged in properly to this interface, We have found that most functionality is hindered somehow, thus not realising if it successfully renders the service or not. Regarding testing for functionality that is not there, there is little to point out, as an Add Publication tab,

\section{The functionality that is correctly implemented - Bravo}
\subsection{General Layout}
\paragraph \newline
The website is aesthetically pleasing and very simple to use. All available links in the navigation bar work correctly and take the user to the relevant webpages. The "Home" link takes the user to the homepage which is just a welcome page. Under the "Publications" section are two links to either add a new publication or list all current publications and both of these links work correctly. Next is a "People" section which has 3 links to either list all users, add a new user or add a new research group respectively and all these links work. The last section of the website is the "Reports" section which contains the link "Query" which generates a report for the user and this also works correctly.

		\subsection{Publications}
			\paragraph \newline
				The "List Publications" section correctly displays the publications that have been added to the system, however they appear to have been hard coded because after adding a publication the list remains the same as it was before adding it. For each publication in the list, there is a "View Publication" button and an "Edit Publication" button which both, after having been clicked, provide the user with the means to either view or edit the publication depending on which button they clicked. When viewing the publication, the user can choose to export it either as a CSV file or as a Bibtex file and both of these work correctly. When adding a new publication, the user can enter all the relevant details of that publication or they can choose to import the details from a CSV file which is working correctly.

			\subsection{People}
				\paragraph \newline
					The "List People" section displays details about the users, including which research field they are part of. For each person in the list, there is a means by which the user can view or edit their information. Both of these buttons work correctly. When editing a person, the user has the option to import the information from a CSV file which is functioning correctly. When adding a person, the user can enter all the relevant details by making use of the various fields or they can opt to once again import a CSV file. The "Adding a Research Group" section correctly provides the user to enter the details of the new research group.

			\subsection{Reports}
				\paragraph \newline
					This section allows the user to type in the details of the publication that a report must be generated for. The user must enter the publication type and the name of a person or research group that the publication is assigned to. After clicking the "Generate Report" button, the user is taken to a page which displays all of the research groups and the publications that they are part of.
		
\section{Architecture Compliance Analysis}
\subsection{Analysis of Alpha Team}	
\subsubsection{Which aspects of the software architecture specification were adhered to - Alpha}
The architecture specifications that were followed are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Add publication
	\item Change Publication state
	\item Organize publications according to researcher-category
	\item Organize publications according to research-group
	\item Templating
	\item Pre-compilation of templates
	\item Automatic Model population
	\item Virtual DOM
	\item Javascript is used
	\item integrates well with npm
\end{itemize}
The sections listed above are the sections that were testable and thus could be classified as parts of the specification that were followed.
					
			\subsubsection{Software Architecture Specifications Partially Complied To - Alpha}
				\paragraph \newline
				The technologies that were specified in the Architectural Requirements were as follows:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Bower
					\item Ember CLI
					\item Node.js with npm
					\item Broccolli
					\item QUnit
					\item PhantomJS
				\end{itemize}
				All of which were involved in the implementation of the Alpha web interface. Thus, nothing can be said in regard to any of the Architecture Specifications only being partially complied to.

\subsubsection{Which aspects of the software architecture specification were not implemented - Alpha}	
\begin{itemize}
	\item Get publication
	\item Automatic rebuild on file changes
	\item Caching
	\item Integration with the rest of the system
	\item No controllers for MVC, but models and views were implemented
\end{itemize}
The features that are listed above were not identifiable on the work done. The MVC feature was only missing the controllers in order to fully follow the MVC pattern. The web was also not integrated to the rest of the system.

\subsection{Analysis of Bravo Team}

\subsubsection{Aspects of Specification which were adhered to - Bravo}
	The architecture specifications that were adhered to are as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Built on \textit{Ember.js}
		\item Integrated with \textit{Node Package Manager} (NPM)
		\item Change Publication state (Functional)
		\item Organize publications according to researcher-category (Functional)
		\item Organize publications according to research-group (Functional)
		\item JavaScript Implementation
	\end{itemize}
	
The sections listed above are the sections that were testable and thus could be classified as parts of the specification that were followed.

\subsubsection{Partial Compliance to Specifications \& Shortcomings - Bravo}
\paragraph{This section serves to outline which sections of the Architecture Specification the System partially complies with. This section also serves to outline any shortcomings with the current implementation of the system.}

\subsubsection{Aspects of the Specification which were not Implemented}
\paragraph{This section outlines parts of the specification which were not implemented by Bravo Team's Web Interface.}
